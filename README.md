# unspace: C/C++ code minifier

[Sometimes](https://ioccc.org) you want to make your code as small as possible. This simple tool will help you by removing unnecessary whitespace (including backslash-newlines, I hope) and comments. No smart optimizations, no renaming and no support for exotic edge-cases. Fix it by yourself!

Not tested on C++, real world C or any platform except my PC.
